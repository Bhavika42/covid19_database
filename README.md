🦠 COVID-19 Database Management System
📌 Overview

This project focuses on storing, organizing, and analyzing official COVID-19 data (up to 2023) — including global deaths, cases, and vaccination statistics — using SQL. It demonstrates data management, query optimization, and insights generation through structured database design.

🧩 Features

Designed a relational database to store large-scale COVID-19 data efficiently.

Implemented SQL queries for data retrieval, aggregation, and statistical analysis.

Performed comparative studies on vaccination progress and mortality rates across regions.

Optimized query performance using indexes and joins for faster insights.

Generated trend-based outputs for year-wise and country-wise case analysis.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Database: MySQL

Languages/Tools: SQL, DB Browser / MySQL Workbench

Data Source: Official COVID-19 statistics (up to 2023)

🧠 Insights
Observed a steady rise in vaccination rates correlated with a notable decline in global mortality after mid-2021.

Identified regional vaccination gaps, highlighting potential data-driven policy interventions.
